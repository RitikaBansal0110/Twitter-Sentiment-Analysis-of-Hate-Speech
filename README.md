# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-of-hate-speech
Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining) is one of the many applications of Natural Language Processing. It is a set of methods and techniques used for extracting subjective information from text or speech, such as opinions or attitudes. In simple terms, it involves classifying a piece of text as positive, negative or neutral.

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets. Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.
